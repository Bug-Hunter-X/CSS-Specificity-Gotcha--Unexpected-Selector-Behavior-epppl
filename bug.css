The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div.container p {
  color: blue;
}

.container p {
  color: red;
}

```

In this case, both selectors target the same HTML element (a paragraph within a div with the class "container"). The first selector (`div.container p`) uses a more specific selector than the second selector (`.container p`). As per CSS specificity rules, the first selector will always override the second one.
